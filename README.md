# MEAN Stack: Developing an app with Angular 2+ and the Angular CLI

This is a simple single page web application to demonstrate the popular web stack called MEAN.

## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/)

## Installation Steps

```
npm install
```

The angular front-end code is located inside the `angular-src`. 

Do a `npm install` inside the `angular-src` directory so that npm can install all the angular dependencies

Angular-CLI's

```
ng build
```

should compile the static code into the root `public` directory.

Run `npm start` to get this started!
